I am a PhD student in Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun). My research agenda is broadly aimed at the development of methods for machine learning, including methods for the problems of

Numerical optimization
Monte Carlo estimation
Bayesian computation
Reinforcement learning
I am generally focused on the application of these methods at scale in deep learning and in theory that unifies their analysis.
I spend two days a week as a Research Scientist at DeepMind. I am an Open Philanthropy AI Fellow. I received my MSc. from the University of Toronto, working with Geoffrey Hinton. I received a NIPS Best Paper Award in 2014, and was one of the founding members of the AlphaGo project.
